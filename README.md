# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

## Project Description

This project implements a fully functional Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) smart contract that enables democratic governance and collective decision-making on the blockchain. The DAO allows members to create proposals, vote on important decisions, and execute approved changes autonomously without centralized control.

The smart contract features a governance token system where members hold voting power proportional to their token holdings. All proposals require a minimum quorum and majority approval before execution, ensuring democratic participation in organizational decisions.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, trustless, and democratic governance system that empowers communities to make collective decisions without relying on traditional hierarchical structures. This DAO implementation serves as a foundation for building decentralized organizations that operate entirely on-chain, promoting transparency, accountability, and equal participation.

We envision this system being used by:
- Decentralized protocols for governance decisions
- Investment DAOs for funding allocation
- Community organizations for democratic decision-making
- Decentralized project management and resource allocation

## Key Features

### üó≥Ô∏è **Proposal Creation & Management**
